VEHICLE: Will hold info. about the dealership(name, address,...) and maintain an list of vehicles. Since it has the list of vehicles, it will also have the methods that search the list for matching vehicles as well as add/remove vehicles.
DEALERSHIP: Will be responsible for reading the dealership file, parsing the data, and creating a Dealership object full of vehicles from the file. It will also be responsible for saving a dealership and the vehicles back into the file in the same pipe-delimited format.
